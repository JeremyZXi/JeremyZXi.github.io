# Drone ✖️ AI
### Goal
To acquire expertise in machine learning for drone image processing and flight control, I intend to construct a drone that
incorporates image processing capabilities, such as posture recognition, as well as the fundamental components of flight
control.

I hope to acquire both foundational and advanced knowledge in machine learning as well as practical experience in
constructing a drone. I aim to employ AI to tackle real-life problems, enhancing the convenience of people's daily lives.
Additionally, this project will equip me with invaluable expertise that can aid me in pursuing further ventures related to AI,
engineering, or computer science.
### Product/Outcome
Product:
The proposed concept involves an AI model that has been trained to identify specific postures, gestures, or movements of
humans. This model will be integrated into a drone, enabling it to utilize the model for flight control and other
functionalities.
Specifications:
Data-collection: collection sufficient amount of positive and negative data for the model
Programm: A program that works
AI model: A model that can recongonize motions and posture of human
Drone: A drone that do certain operation with the output of the AI model
