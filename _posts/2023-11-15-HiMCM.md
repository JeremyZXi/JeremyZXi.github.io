这次怎么说呢。。。尸体！！！！全都是挡路的尸体！！！！那个表达式写的比祖上十八代都复杂您是要干嘛？？？？？？最后还**的是错的？！？！！
<!--more-->
咳咳。。以上均为发疯内容
## 整体
- 最开始几天一直在扯犊子，现在想想那个向量场或许是对的，但是某人能不能给我讲明白是个未知数。按照我的数学水平大概率讲不明白
- 做之前规划一下，14天看着多其实真没几天，其实如果真的严格按照[时间线](https://jeremyzxi.github.io/2023/10/23/HiMCM-Time.html)做的话是完全有能力拿一个奖的
- 找熟人，这个比赛流畅的沟通能力和卓越的学术能力的权重应该是差不多的，找的人最好是厉害的同时能放开喷的。
- 有问题就直接喷，藏着掖着就是耽误时间

## 我个人
- 程序的底层是逻辑，没有逻辑的程序就算不是错的其真实性也有待考量。
- 开头应该先把这整个事情的逻辑搞懂了，不是说有一个公式就行了的，具体的操作还是程序的事情。
- 不要轻易篡改结果，发现结果不对的话先想想是不是这个写法的底层逻辑和物理意义就不对，不要想着去编一个看起来很好看的参数但是本质上就不对
- 干之前要把这个事情倒腾明白了，直接干大概率是干出来的都是错的
- GPT不可靠，就算用也只能当语法查询器或者给一个基础的框架（截至2023/11/）
- 还是不熟练，有的常见的图的程序应该早点准备好的。
- 数学！！！！！还是不够好
- 能抄就别自己想（指底层逻辑）
- 参数这个东西绝对不是瞎调的。。。虽然叫炼丹但那也是基于结果的“科学”炼丹
## 最后
- 找靠谱的队友，得是那种能互相放得开有事直接喷的
- 开头就把事情捋明白，这个很重要

这一趟下来还是学到不少的，总体来说这东西的 $$E(x)$$ 还是挺高的哈哈哈哈哈哈。其实也不敢说真的学会了什么东西，但是至少是知道了这些东西的存在吧，不是以前那种说到机器学习就只知道CNN和一些自己不知道什么原理的回归的我了。当然你说我真的完全明白了嘛？那当然是没有的，但是这或许算是一个比较好的开始吧。毕竟这个时代，数学几乎无处不在呢。。


### P.S.
[Python Code For ARIMA](https://jeremyzxi.github.io/2023/10/16/ARIMA-code.html)写这种东西似乎能帮我梳理一下知识，以后有机会多写一些没有坏处

**还有，文件夹一定要整理！！！！！**

**文件命名不要untitled！！！！！写明白了真的非常非常非常非常非常非常重要** 一定要明确这个文件是哪里的，干嘛的，哪个版本

![杂乱的文件夹]({{ "assets/img/2023_HiMCM杂乱的文件.png" | relative_url}})

⬆️就长这b样的就得拉出去枪毙（枪毙我自己.jpg）
**代码就算是抄的也要把注释写明白！！！！**

虽然说搞的是理科，但是一个让人看得顺眼，一眼就明白的可视化还是很重要的。要是可视化看起来就让别人就不想多看一眼那也是不可接受的

要学的东西还是很多的嘛

# English Version
How should I put it this time... Corpses!! All blocking corpses!! That expression is more complex than the ancestors' generations. What are you trying to do??? And in the end, it's still wrong?!?!

*Cough* *cough*... The above is all crazy talk.

## Overall
- At the beginning, I was just talking nonsense for a few days. Now I think that the vector field might be correct, but whether someone can explain it clearly to me is an unknown. According to my level of mathematics, I probably won't be able to explain it clearly.
- Plan ahead before doing anything. 14 days might seem like a lot, but if we strictly follow the [timeline](https://jeremyzxi.github.io/2023/10/23/HiMCM-Time.html), we are totally capable of winning an award.
- Find someone familiar. The weight of smooth communication skills and outstanding academic abilities in this competition should be about the same. It's best to find someone who is skilled and can also be critical.
- If there's a problem, just criticize directly. Keeping things hidden only wastes time.

## Personal
- The foundation of a program is logic. A program without logic, even if it's not wrong, its truthfulness is still questionable.
- At the beginning, we should first understand the logic of the whole thing. It's not just about having a formula; the specific operations are still about the program.
- Don't easily tamper with results. If you find the results are incorrect, first think about whether the underlying logic and physical meaning of this approach are wrong. Don't think about creating a parameter that looks good but fundamentally isn't correct.
- Before doing anything, make sure to understand the matter clearly. Most likely, doing something directly will result in everything being wrong.
- GPT is not reliable. Even if used, it can only be used as a grammar checker or to provide a basic framework (as of 2023/11/).
- Still not proficient, some common graph programs should have been prepared earlier.
- Mathematics!!!! Still not good enough.
- If you can copy, don't try to figure it out yourself (referring to the underlying logic).
- Parameters are absolutely not randomly adjusted... Even though it's called alchemy, it's still based on the "scientific" alchemy of results.

## Lastly
- Find reliable teammates, those who can be open with each other and criticize directly when needed.
- At the beginning, understand the matter clearly. This is very important.

I've learned quite a bit from this trip. Overall, the $E(x)$ of this thing is quite high, hahaha. Actually, I dare not say I've truly learned something, but at least I know these things exist, not like before when I only knew about CNN and some regression principles in machine learning. Of course, you ask if I really understand everything? Well, of course not, but perhaps this is a pretty good start. After all, in this era, mathematics is almost everywhere.

### P.S.
Writing things like [Python Code For ARIMA](https://jeremyzxi.github.io/2023/10/16/ARIMA-code.html) seems to help me organize my knowledge. It wouldn't hurt to write more of these in the future.

**Also, make sure to organize your folders!!!!**

**Don't name files "untitled"!!!! It's really, really, really, really, really, really important to clearly state which folder the file is from, what it's for, and which version it is.**

⬆️ If it looks like this, it needs to be taken out and shot (shoot myself.jpg).
**Even if it's copied, make sure to write clear comments in the code!!!!**

Although it's in the field of science, a visualization that is pleasant to look at and easy to understand is still very important. If the visualization makes others not want to look at it, that's unacceptable.

There's still a lot to learn, right?
