I must say that the rules of this competition is complex...Though it is called the "international round", it's still a round within the zhonghua region for some reason.

Things were a bit confusing this time, the problem was kind of perplexed. Initially, I thought it is asking for an evaluation model such as AHP or something. However, that seems toooooooooooooooo "simple" for an international round. Not saying AHP is easy, but the logic flow of it shouldn't be that straight forward.

Also, it's sōóōòōóõ hard to find data. I feel like we are winning the contest at the monment I found the data we used on nature.
