# Movement Detection
<!--more-->
Movement detection, also known as motion detection, is a significant aspect of computer vision. It involves identifying changes in the position of an object relative to its surroundings or the change in the surroundings relative to an object.

## Techniques for Movement Detection

### Frame Differencing
Frame differencing involves comparing the pixel intensities of consecutive frames. If the difference exceeds a certain threshold, it is marked as motion.

```markdown
- Capture two consecutive frames from a video.
- Convert the frames to grayscale.
- Compute the absolute difference between the two frames.
- Apply a threshold to mark the pixels which have a difference greater than the threshold.
```

### Optical Flow
Optical flow is a method used to estimate motion based on the apparent motion of brightness patterns in the image.

```markdown
- Compute the gradient of pixel intensities in the image.
- Estimate the motion for each pixel based on the change in its intensity.
```

### Background Subtraction
Background subtraction involves maintaining a model of the background and subtracting it from the current frame to identify moving objects.

```markdown
- Initialize a background model.
- For each new frame, subtract the background model from the current frame.
- Update the background model to adapt to possible changes in the scene.
```

## Applications of Movement Detection

- Surveillance: Detecting movement in video footage to identify intruders or unusual activity.
- Video Games: Tracking player movements for interactive gameplay.
- Healthcare: Monitoring patient movement in medical applications.
- Traffic Monitoring: Detecting and tracking vehicles in traffic surveillance.

## Tools and Libraries for Movement Detection

- OpenCV: An open-source computer vision library which includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.
- TensorFlow: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning to build and train models.
- PyTorch: An open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.
