This was my second time participating in mathematical modeling (P.S. actually, is it the third time? Since IMMC is a two-stage competition)â€¦ Anyway, it's over, and truly in every sense, it was a sweaty endeavor.

Speaking of mathematical modeling, it seems my math hasn't improved much? There's a lot I know that I don't truly understand. This is a big problem; otherwise, it feels like you know everything when in reality you know nothing, and ending up like Brother B would not be good. However, it might still be fine to become a good "package-caller." I'm still very grateful to Li (02) Song ('s) Mian (darling), although he was previously the appendix sage, doing it is better than not doing it. And so what if it went wrong, isn't this the age when you should be fearless! The appendix eventually got used, didn't it?

This time I guess can be considered my first real defense ever, and honestly, the feeling of one against ten isn't really pleasant. Going back to the main point, I was prepared for most of the questions, except for that one about the specific weights of PCA features on an SVM graph and the one questioning our use of pet ownership as labels through code comments.

Anyway, I explained everything I could, and now it's just a matter of waiting for the results. A funny incident was when the associate professor next to the Fudan professor almost came down to explain it to him for me ðŸ¤£

Another issue was the WI-FI at HongKong City University popping up automatically, which made everything quite chaotic.

The problems this year were pretty weird, with several groups initially using AHP in a uniform manner, filtering with some standards, and then filtering again with another AHP or something similar. Later, others used machine learning methods, which were quite different from ours. They clustered the data into two groups and then labeled the data based on these groups. Actually, there might have been even more interesting solutions in the afternoon, but sadly, I was dragged away to have a mealâ€¦ (and that meal was really not tasty!!!)
## Some other stuff

CityU is quite fun, its entrance is even inside a shopping mall. I really wanted to explore it, but as soon as it ended, I was dragged away to have that not-so-tasty mealâ€¦

It also seems like we created something that looks useful but we don't know how to use it... Although in reality, our solution is quite user-friendly. You just need to fill out a super long questionnaire (foggy).

If I have time during the holidays, it's time to organize the related content and probably post it on this blog.
