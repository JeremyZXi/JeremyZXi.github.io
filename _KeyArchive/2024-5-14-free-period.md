I'm not sure how a few of us came up with this idea... but we've got a wild one. Since the capstone has an official website, why shouldn't other projects made by Keystone students have one too? Some people present their projects at high school assemblies or grade level meetings, and then they leave behind two or three email addresses. Honestly, does anyone really remember them? We doubt it. Furthermore, sometimes you see a great project, and by the time you really want to get involved, or need to get involved (just kidding), it’s already disappeared. So, is it possible to create a centralized platform where everyone's projects are listed? We’ve given it some thought, and the platform would need:

- No code, no code, and more no code.
  After all, we can’t expect every Keystone student to be a computer whiz. In fact, this project itself aims to make this kind of resource accessible to everyone.
- This project should not only cater to the Keystone community internally but also serve as a platform to showcase the Keystone community to society at large. Therefore, getting official recognition from Keystone would be ideal.
- Review: After all, no one knows what our dear classmates might post.
- It should require almost no maintenance, or rather, not require administrators to work overtime every day; everything should ideally be automated. Of course, this is definitely challenging, even perhaps not feasible for us... but after all, we can’t be manually maintaining and updating every day, and our users certainly can’t tolerate delays of 24 to 72 hours.
